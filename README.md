# Match Game

Final assignment of Software Engineering course, H.I.T, 2020.

This project is a match game for children. 
When we were trying to think of an idea for a project, one of our group members wife told us she could really use a simple game of basic actions for children to play and learn,
for her work as a Speech Therapist. 

So we came up with a match game, where the cards are basic actions people do everyday, like walking, sleeping, drinking etc.

The game supports 3 modes:
1. Player vs player - in case the children would like to play against each other.
2. Player vs computer - a competitive mode against a computer
3. Time attack - a competitive mode to beat the clock.

The project consists of 2 design patterns, as well as an architectural pattern:
1. Builder - so we can create different representations of our game board using the same construction process.
2. Observer - to handle event notifications easily. 

In addition, theres an option for statistics screen - Linear learning graph, as well as a leader board graph.
